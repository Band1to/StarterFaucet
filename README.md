Starter Faucet
=============

Starter Faucet is an open-source faucet coin giveaway script. It aims to allow people to set up faucets with ease and allow them to be easily maintained and used.

Getting Started
=============

To get started and set up Starter Faucet all you have to do is to first upload all of the files, then you have to edit "configuration.php" which can be found inside the functions/classes. Once you open that file read what to put where. Also make sure that you give the site a good test before making it live, and keeping all of that information secure.

Requirements
=============

* CoinArea API Key
* Webhost which supports PHP
* (Optional but recommended) reCAPTCHA private / public key

Updates
=============

There are still things planned so expect updates over time, any issues suggestions feel free to make a request here, see the "Plans" below for planned features.

Plans
=============

There are some planned features which will be emerging soon, which will hopefully provide you with more options as well as more customizability.

* More API Providers, this is something which is a high priority, especially if it enables additional cryptocurrencies.
* Allow a leaderboard of top donations, this would allow the top donators to be listed automatically.

About the project
=============

Starter Faucet is open source, this means that anyone can review the code, fork their own changes, and / or merge them into the master branch. The license is GPL 2, more information can be found in the LICENSE file which can be used to see what is allowed to be used with the script. I will keep a best effort to keep the code updated, bug free, add new features and provide basic support.

Donations
=============

Starter Faucet is provided free of charge, so we never require any payments. But if you wish to donate to the project to allow it to stay updated and add new features, then you are free to.

LTC Donation: 
DOGE Donation: 

We only accept Bitcoins, Litecoins, and Dogecoins right now. If you are using another coin and would like to donate we recommend exchanging it into a coin above. Donations ensure that the project is kept alive and allows more time to be put into working on the project.
